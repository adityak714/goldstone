# Project Goldstone

**The Idea**

The idea of Goldstone is to provide an easily accessible Pomodoro timer along with quality study music, in an attempt to reduce the resistance of starting to work. The Pomodoro technique has been scientifically proven to increase productivity, and along with being an essential component of goldstone is also the inspiration for the idea. 



**How to Use**

The process of using goldstone could not be simpler, just click on the start timer button and the timer will start to count down from 25 minutes. Music will play from the default study playlist (this can be changed in the settings).

In order to change the playlist, simply paste in the link to a YouTube playlist of your choice, make sure that the playlist is public or else the program will not work as intended. 

In the settings, you can also chose to continue playing music even after the timer has run out. You can also chose to play the playlist in the correct order instead of shuffling it, and you can easily switch between the light and dark mode.
